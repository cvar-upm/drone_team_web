    Thermal hotspots in photovoltaic modules are a leading cause of performance loss, accelerated
    degradation, and safety concerns, making timely and scalable detection essential for modern solar
    farm operations. This article presents a hybrid approach that combines classical computer vision
    with deep learning to analyze radiometric thermal imagery, demonstrating that complementary methods
    can be orchestrated to balance interpretability, robustness, and speed. The proposed workflow
    emphasizes rapid prototyping and modularity, enabling practitioners to assemble a practical
    end-to-end pipeline&mdash;from data capture and preprocessing through candidate generation,
    classification, and reporting&mdash;using readily available tools and modest datasets.
