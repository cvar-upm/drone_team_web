  <h2>A2RL  Season 1</h2>
  <p>
A2RL - Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League is widely regarded as the leading international competition in autonomous drone racing, 
challenging teams to develop AI-driven systems capable of flying fully autonomously using only onboard sensors and computation. 
The team competed using its own open-source framework, Aerostack2, a modular platform integrating perception, trajectory planning, 
and flight control. During the competition, the drone completed two full laps of a 22-gate circuit relying solely on an onboard camera 
and IMU, processing all data in real time onboard. The team ranked among the top eight international finalists and achieved second place 
in the multi-drone race within their group, demonstrating the robustness and maturity of the technologies developed for both industrial and 
high-performance autonomous applications.
