In this international competition focused on urban firefighting with drones, the team 
 developed a fully autonomous UAV system capable of navigating through obstacles, detecting 
 a visual marker representing a building window, and accurately deploying a fire-extinguishing 
 device by releasing a magnetically attached ball at the precise moment in flight. The solution 
 integrated onboard 3D mapping from depth images, obstacle-aware path planning, and a physics-based
release algorithm that computed the optimal drop timing based on the drone’s velocity. After achieving 
the highest score in the virtual phase, the team won first prize in the live final held in Dubrovnik, Croatia.

    Thermal hotspots in photovoltaic modules are a leading cause of performance loss, accelerated
    degradation, and safety concerns, making timely and scalable detection essential for modern solar
    farm operations. This article presents a hybrid approach that combines classical computer vision
    with deep learning to analyze radiometric thermal imagery, demonstrating that complementary methods
    can be orchestrated to balance interpretability, robustness, and speed. The proposed workflow
    emphasizes rapid prototyping and modularity, enabling practitioners to assemble a practical
    end-to-end pipeline&mdash;from data capture and preprocessing through candidate generation,
    classification, and reporting&mdash;using readily available tools and modest datasets.
